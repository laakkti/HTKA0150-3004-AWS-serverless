When you're asked to input or copy-paste GeoJSON geometry data, you can find examples in the following file:

For example, searching for "Akanpelto", which Iâ€™ve used in my examples, will load the data quickly because it already exists in MongoDB. Selecting another area will trigger the process of fetching data from Sentinel Hub and storing it into MongoDB Atlas, which typically takes several tens of seconds depending on the size of the area and how many NDVI maps are available for that period (currently, the settings includes data from both this year and last year).
