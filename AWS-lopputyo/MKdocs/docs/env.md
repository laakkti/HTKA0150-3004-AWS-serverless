Because this is just demo case the keys and passwords etc. can be publiched, normally never do that.

```javascript
# mongodb
mongoURI="mongodb+srv://laakktidev:AA4598@develop.pgqgteo.mongodb.net/ndvidb?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
```

**mongoUri** is a connection string, which is used for establishing a connection to MongoDB 
implemented in module mongodb.js which is kind of API for mongoDb.
